Introduction
------------
The official MongoDB Node.js driver allows Node.js applications to
connect to MongoDB and work with data. The driver features both
callback-based and Promise-based interaction with MongoDB.

.. note::

   These docs are for version 3.5 of the MongoDB Node.js driver. If
   you are looking for an older version of the MongoDB Node.js driver
   docs, :node-docs:`see the Legacy Node.js driver documentation <>`.
   For the main MongoDB documentation, see the :manual:`MongoDB Manual
   </>`.
