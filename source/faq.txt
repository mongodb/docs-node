What Is the Difference Between "connectTimeoutMS", "socketTimeoutMS" and "maxTimeMS" ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Default Value
     - Description
   * - connectTimeoutMS
     - 30000
     - ``connectTimeoutMS`` is a `connection-setting <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.5/reference/connecting/connection-settings/>`_ option that sets the time in milliseconds to establish a connection to the MongoDB server before timing out.
   * - socketTimeoutMS
     - 360000
     - ``socketTimeoutMS`` is a ``connection-settings`` option that sets the number of milliseconds a socket stays inactive after the driver has successfully connected before closing the connection.
   * - maxTimeMS
     - N/A
     - :node-api:`maxTimeMS() </Cursor.html#maxTimeMS>` is a :manual:`cursor method </reference/method/js-cursor>` that specifies the max time limit for processing an operation on a cursor. If an operation runs over the time allotted it will return a timeout error.

How Can I Prevent the Driver From Hanging During Connection or From Spending Too Long Trying to Reach Unreachable Replica Sets?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To prevent the driver from hanging during connection or to prevent the
driver from spending too long trying to reach unreachable replica sets,
you can set the ``connectTimeoutMS`` option of your
``connection-settings``. Generally, you should ensure that the
``connectTimeoutMS`` setting is not lower than the longest network
latency you have to a member of the set. If one of the secondary members
is on the other side of the planet and has a latency of 10000
milliseconds, setting the ``connectTimeoutMS`` to anything lower will
prevent the driver from ever connecting to that member.

Should I Use "socketTimeoutMS" as a Way of Preventing Long-Running Operations From Slowing Down the Server?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, you should **not** use ``socketTimeoutMS`` to end operations that
may run for too long and slow down the application. Attempting to do so
may not achieve the intended result.

Closing the socket causes a reconnect of the driver's connection pool,
introducing latency to any other queued up operations. Chronically slow
operations will, therefore, cause a large number of reconnect requests,
negatively impacting throughput and performance.

Also, closing the socket does not terminate the operation; it will
continue to run on the MongoDB server, which could cause data
inconsistencies if the application retries the operation on failure.

However, there are important use cases for ``socketTimeoutMS`` -
consider the following cases:

- A MongoDB process erroring out
- A misconfigured firewall causing a socket connection without sending a ``FIN`` packet

In those cases, there is no way to detect that the connection has died.
Setting the ``socketTimeoutMS`` is essential to ensure that the sockets
are closed correctly. A good rule of thumb is to set ``socketTimeoutMS``
to two to three times the length of the slowest operation that runs
through the driver.

How Can I Prevent Sockets From Timing out Before They Become Active?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Having a large connection pool does not always reduce reconnection
requests.  Consider the following example:

An application has a connection pool size of 5 sockets and has the
``socketTimeoutMS`` option set to 5000 milliseconds. Operations occur,
on average, every 3000 milliseconds, and reconnection requests are
frequent. Each socket times out after 5000 milliseconds, which means
that all sockets must do something during those 5000 milliseconds to
avoid closing.

One message every 3000 milliseconds is not enough to keep the sockets
active, so several of the sockets will time out after 5000 milliseconds.
Reduce the ``poolSize`` in the connection settings to fix the problem.

What Does a Value of "0" mean for "connectTimeoutMS" and "socketTimeoutMS"?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting ``connectTimeoutMS`` and ``socketTimeoutMS`` to the value ``0`` has
causes the application to use the operating system's default socket timeout value.

How Can I Prevent Long-Running Operations From Slowing Down the Server?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

By using ``maxTimeMS()`` you can prevent long-running operations from
slowing down the server. This method allows the MongoDB server to cancel
operations that run for more than the set value of ``maxTimeMS``.

The following example demonstrates how to use MaxTimeMS with a find
operation:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/faq/maxTimeMS-example.js
  :language: javascript
  :linenos:

What Does the "keepAlive" Setting Do?
---------------------------------------

``keepAlive`` is a ``connection-setting`` that sets the number of
milliseconds to wait before initiating a :wikipedia:`TLS keepAlive
<Keepalive#TCP_keepalive>` on a TCP Socket. The ``keepAlive`` option
will keep a socket alive by sending periodic probes to MongoDB. However,
this only works if the operating system supports ``SO_KEEPALIVE``\ .

.. warning::
    If a firewall ignores or drops the ``keepAlive`` packets this may not work

What Can I Do If I'm Experiencing Unexpected Network Behavior?
--------------------------------------------------------------
Internal firewalls that exist between application servers and MongoDB
are often misconfigured and are overly aggressive in their removal of
socket connections.

If you experience unexpected network behavior, here
are some things to check:

#. The firewall should send a ``FIN packet`` when closing a socket,allowing the driver to detect that the socket is closed.
#. The firewall should allow ``keepAlive`` probes.

What Can I Do If I'm Getting "ECONNRESET" When Calling "client.connect()"?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In most operating systems, each connection is associated with a `file
descriptor
<https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/file-descriptor.htm>`_. There is
typically a limit set by the operating system on the number of file
descriptors used by a single process. An ``ECONNRESET`` error can occur
if the connection pool size surpasses the limit of ``file descriptors``.

Consider the following operation:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/faq/econnresetWithClientConnect-example.js
  :language: javascript
  :linenos:

If this operation causes an ``ECONNRESET`` error, you may have run into
the ``file descriptor`` limit for your Node.js process. In that case you
must increase the number of ``file descriptors`` for the Node.js process. On
MacOS and Linux you do this with the `ulimit
<https://ss64.com/bash/ulimit.html>`_ shell command.

.. code-block:: sh

   ulimit -n 6000

This sets the maximum number of ``file descriptors`` for the process to
6000, allowing Node.js to connect with a pool size of 5000 sockets.

How Can I Prevent a Slow Operation From Delaying Other Operations?
------------------------------------------------------------------

A slow operation may delay your other operations that occur after it, if
the ``poolSize`` has not been set in the `connection settings
<https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.5/reference/connecting/connection-settings/>`_.
MongoDB is synchronous and uses a single execution thread per socket,
meaning that MongoDB will execute one single operation per socket at any
point in time. Any other operation sent to that socket will have to wait
until the current operation is finished. If you have a slow-running
operation that holds up other operations, the best solution is to create
a separate connection pool for the slow operation, isolating it from
other, faster operations.

.. note::
    If the number of operations is greater than the set ``poolSize`` and
    a slow operation occurs, subsequent operations will be delayed.

How Can I Ensure My Connection String Is Valid for a Replica Set?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The connection string passed to the driver must use exact hostnames for
the servers as set in the :manual:`Replica Set Config </reference/replica-configuration/>`.
Given the following configuration settings for your Replica Set, in
order for the Replica Set discovery and :manual:`failover
</reference/glossary/#term-failover>` to work the driver should be able
to reach ``server1``, ``server2``, and ``server3``.
