   .. step:: Install Node and npm

      Ensure you have Node.js {+min-node-version+} or later and 
      npm (Node Package Manager) installed in your development environment.

      For information on how to install Node.js and npm, see
      `downloading and installing Node.js and npm <https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm>`__.

   .. step:: Create a Project Directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``node_quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir node_quickstart

      Run the following command to navigate into the project 
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd node_quickstart

      Run the following command to initialize your Node.js project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npm init -y

      When this command successfully completes, you have a ``package.json`` 
      file in your ``node_quickstart`` directory.


   .. step:: Install the Node.js Driver

      Run the following command in your shell to install
      the driver in your project directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         npm install mongodb@{+version+}

      This command performs the following actions:

      - Downloads the ``mongodb`` package and the dependencies it requires
      - Saves the package in the ``node_modules`` directory
      - Records the dependency information in the ``package.json`` file

After you complete these steps, you have Node.js and npm installed 
and a new project directory with the driver dependencies installed.
