Setup
=====

Ensure Node and NPM are Installed
---------------------------------

Ensure your system has Node >= 8 and NPM installed. If you need to install Node
and NPM, refer to `nodejs.org <https://nodejs.org>`_ for installation instructions.

NPM Init
--------

The starting point for any Node application is initializing your project. Navigate
to a new directory and initialize a new project.

.. code-block:: js

   mkdir node_quickstart
   cd node_quickstart
   npm init -y

.. admonition:: Why the ``-y``?
   :class: note

   Specifying ``-y`` tells **NPM** to use defaults from your system.


Add MongoDB as a Dependency
---------------------------

Next, we need to add the driver as a project dependency. We'll use the ``-s`` flag
to save the dependency to our ``package.json`` file that was automatically generated
in the previous step.

.. code-block:: js

   npm install -s mongodb
