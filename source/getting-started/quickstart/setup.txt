Setup
=====

Ensure Node and NPM are Installed
---------------------------------

Ensure your system has Node >= 8 and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. If
you need to install Node and NPM, refer to `nodejs.org <https://nodejs.org>`_
for installation instructions.

NPM Init
--------

The starting point for any Node application is initializing your project. Navigate
to a new directory and initialize a new project.

.. code-block:: js

   mkdir node_quickstart
   cd node_quickstart
   npm init -y

.. admonition:: Why the -y?
   :class: note

   Specifying ``-y`` tells NPM to use defaults from your system.


Add MongoDB as a Dependency
---------------------------

Next, we need to add the driver as a project dependency. We'll use the ``-s`` flag
to save the dependency to our ``package.json`` file that was automatically generated
in the previous step.

.. code-block:: js

   npm install -s mongodb

NPM will download dependencies and output information to your terminal. After
installing, you should have a ``node_modules`` directory added to your workspace.

Atlas
-----

The easiest way to get started with MongoDB is by using `MongoDB Atlas <https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`_.
Atlas doesn't require a credit card to sign up, and offers free-tier deployments that are free for life.
Follow along with our :atlas:`Getting Started with Atlas <_atlas-getting-started>` guide
to create a free account and deploy a free-tier cluster, then :atlas:`load sample data <_load-sample-data>` to
get the data necessary for the rest of this guide.
