Overview
--------

This guide will show you how to set up a simple application using Node.js and
MongoDB. Its scope is limited to setting up the driver to connect to a free-tier
`Atlas <https://mongodb.com/cloud/atlas?tck=docs_node>`_ cluster.

If you are new to MongoDB, reading our `CRUD Guide </crud-guide>`_ is an excellent next step.

To view common operations, refer to our `usage examples </usage-examples>`_ section.
