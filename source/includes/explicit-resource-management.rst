.. tip:: Explicit Resource Management 

    As of v6.9, the {+driver-short+} supports explicit resource management for
    ``MongoClient``, ``ClientSession``, ``ChangeStreams``, and cursors. This is
    an experimental feature and subject to change. To learn how to use explicit
    resource management, see the `v6.9 Release Notes
    <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.9.0>`__ on
    GitHub.
