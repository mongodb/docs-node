.. note:: Explicit Resource Management 

    Since v6.9, the {+driver-long+} now natively supports explicit resource
    management for ``MongoClient``, ``ClientSession``, ``ChangeStreams``, and
    cursors. To learn how to use explicit resource management, see
    the `v6.9 Release Notes
    <https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v6.9.0>`__ on
    GitHub. It is important to note that this is an experimental feature and
    subject to change.
