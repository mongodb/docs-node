Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about how {+driver-short+} uses connection pools to manage
connections to a MongoDB deployment and how you can configure connection pool settings
in your application.

A connection pool is a cache of open database connections maintained by {+driver-short+}.
When your application requests a connection to MongoDB, {+driver-short+} seamlessly
gets a connection from the pool, performs operations, and returns the connection
to the pool for reuse.

Connection pools help reduce application latency and the number of times new connections
are created by {+driver-short+}.
