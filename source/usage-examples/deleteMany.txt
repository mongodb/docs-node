Delete Many Documents
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can delete several documents in a collection at once with
``collection.deleteMany()``.
The ``deleteMany()`` method uses a query document that you provide
to match only the subset of the documents in the collection that match
the query. If you don't provide a query document (or if you provide an
empty document), MongoDB matches all documents in the collection. All
matched documents are deleted. While you can use ``deleteMany()`` to
delete all documents in a collection, consider using
`drop() <http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.4/api/Collection.html#drop>`_
instead for better performance and clearer code.

You can define additional query options using the ``options``
object passed as the second parameter of the ``deleteMany()`` method.
You can also pass a
`callback method <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#~deleteWriteOpCallback>`_
as an optional third parameter. For detailed reference documentation,
see
`collection.deleteMany() <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#deleteMany>`_.

``deleteMany()`` behaves in two different ways depending on
whether or not a callback method is provided:

- if no callback method is provided, ``deleteMany()`` returns a
  `Promise <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`_
  that resolves to an
  `Object <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>`_

- if a callback method is provided, ``deleteMany()`` returns
  nothing, and instead passes the result object or error object to the
  provided callback method

The
`result object <http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.2/api/Collection.html#~deleteWriteOpResult>`_
contains multiple keys in the event of a successful
execution. You can use the ``deletedCount`` key to determine the number
of documents deleted by the operation.

The error object contains ``errmsg``, a human-readable explanation of
what caused the operation to fail.

Example
-------

The following snippet deletes multiple documents from the ``movies``
collection. It uses a **query document** that configures the query to
match and delete only movies with the title "Santa Claus".
