Open a Change Stream
--------------------

You can watch for changes to a single collection, a database, or an entire deployment in MongoDB with **Change Streams**.
Open a change stream by calling the ``watch()`` method on a ``Collection``, ``Db``, or ``MongoClient`` object. The
change stream emits **change event** documents when they occur.

The ``watch()`` method optionally takes an **aggregation pipeline** which consists of an array of **aggregation stages**
as the first parameter. The aggregation stages filter and transform the change events.

In the following snippet, the ``$match`` stage will match all change event documents with a ``runtime`` value of less than
15, filtering all others out.

.. code-block:: javascript

   const pipeline = [ { $match: { runtime: { $lt: 15 } } } ];
   const changeStream = collection.watch(pipeline);

The ``watch()`` method accepts an ``options`` object as the second parameter. Refer to the links at the end of this
section for more information on the settings you can configure with this object.

The ``watch()`` method returns an instance of a `ChangeStream <{+api+}/classes/ChangeStream.html>`__. You can read events from
change streams by iterating over them or listening for events. Select the tab that corresponds to the way you want to
read events from the change stream below.

.. tabs::

   .. tab::
      :tabid: Iterative

      You can call methods on the ``ChangeStream`` object such as:

      - ``hasNext()`` to check for remaining documents in the stream
      - ``next()`` to request the next document in the stream
      - ``close()`` to close the ChangeStream


   .. tab::
      :tabid: Event

      You can attach listener functions to the ``ChangeStream``  object by calling the ``on()`` method. This method is inherited from the Javascript
      ``EventEmitter`` class. Pass the string ``"change"`` as the first parameter and your callback function as the
      second parameter as shown below:

      .. code-block:: javascript

         changeStream.on("change", (changeEvent) => { /* your callback function */ });

      The callback function triggers when a change event is emitted. You can specify logic in the callback to process
      the change event document when it is received.


      You can control the change stream by calling ``pause()`` to stop emitting events or ``resume()`` to continue to emit events.

      To stop processing change events, call the `close() <{+api+}/classes/ChangeStream.html#close>`__ method on the
      ``ChangeStream`` instance. This closes the change stream and frees resources.

      .. code-block:: javascript

         changeStream.close();

Example
-------

The following example opens a change stream on the ``haiku`` collection in
the ``insert_db`` database. Let's create a listener function to receive and
print change events that occur on the collection.

First, open the change stream on the collection and then define a callback
on the change stream using the ``on()`` method. Once set, generate the
change event on the collection, run the :doc:`insert a document usage
example <insertOne>` in a different shell.

Since it may take some time for the listener function pick up the change
event, we use a timer. We define the timer with ``simulateAsyncPause``
to wait 20 seconds before closing the ``ChangeStream`` instance using
the ``close()`` method.

.. note::

   The timer used in this example is only necessary for this demonstration
   to make sure there is enough time to pick up the change event before
   exiting. If you need more or less time, modify the
   ``simulateAsyncPause`` declaration.

.. note:: Identical Code Snippets

   The JavaScript and TypeScript code snippets above are identical. There are no
   TypeScript specific features of the driver relevant to this use case.

If you run the preceding example, you should see the following output:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :copyable: false

   received a change to the collection: 	 {
      _id: {
         _data: '8261...'
      },
      operationType: 'insert',
      clusterTime: new Timestamp({ t: 1631216117, i: 9 }),
      fullDocument: {
         _id: new ObjectId("..."),
         title: 'Record of a Shriveled Datum',
         content: 'No bytes, no problem. Just insert a document, in MongoDB'
      },
      ns: { db: 'insert_db', coll: 'haiku' },
      documentKey: { _id: new ObjectId("...") }
      }

.. note:: Receive Full Documents From Updates

   Change events that contain information on update operations only return the modified
   fields by default rather than the full updated document. You can configure
   your change stream to also return the most current version of the document
   by setting the ``fullDocument`` field of the options object to
   ``"updateLookup"`` as follows:

   .. code-block:: javascript
      :emphasize-lines: 1, 5

      const options = { fullDocument: "updateLookup" };
      // This could be any pipeline.
      const pipeline = [];

      const changeStream = collection.watch(pipeline, options);
