==========================================
Distinct Values of a Field in a Collection
==========================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can retrieve a list of distinct values for a field across a collection
by using the `distinct()
<https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.4/api/Collection.html#distinct>`_
method. Call the ``distinct()`` method on a Collection object with
a document field name parameter as a String to produce a list that contains
one of each of the different values found in the specified document field.

You can specify a document field within an *embedded document* using `dot
notation
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/document/#embedded-documents>`_. If
you call ``distinct()`` on an document field that contains an array, each
element of the array is treated as a separate value.

You can provide an optional query document to narrow the set of documents that
are searched and an optional Object to specify additional query parameters.
For details on the optional parameters, see the
`distinct() method in the API documentation
<https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.4/api/Collection.html#distinct>`_.

The ``distinct()`` method returns a
`Promise <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`_
that resolves to an
`Array <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array>`_
that contains each of the different values. If none of the documents in the
collection contain the field specified in the method call, it returns an
empty Array.

If you specify a value for the document field name that is not of type
String such as a Document, Array, Number, or ``null``, the method does not
execute and returns a TypeMismatch error with a message that resembles
the following:

::

   "key" had the wrong type. Expected string, found <non-string type>


Example
-------

The following snippet retrieves a list of distinct values for the ``year``
document field from the ``movies`` collection. It uses a query document to
match only movies that include "Barbara Streisand" as a ``director``.
