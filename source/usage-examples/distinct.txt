===================================
Retrieve Distinct Values of a Field
===================================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can retrieve a list of distinct values for a field across a
collection by using the :node-api:`collection.distinct()
<Collection.html#distinct>` method. Call the ``distinct()`` method
on a ``Collection`` object with a document field name parameter as a
``String`` to produce a list that contains one of each of the different
values found in the specified document field.

You can specify a document field within an *embedded document* using
:manual:`dot
notation </core/document/#embedded-documents>`. If
you call ``distinct()`` on an document field that contains an array,
the method treats each element as a separate value.

You can provide an optional query document to apply the ``distinct()``
method to the results that match the query. You can specify additional
query parameters by passing an optional ``Object``. For details on the
query parameters, see the :node-api:`distinct() method in the API
documentation <Collection.html#distinct>`.

The ``distinct()`` method returns a
:mdn:`Promise <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>` that
resolves to an :mdn:`Array
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array>` that contains each of
the different values. If none of the documents in the collection contain
the field specified in the method call, it returns an empty Array.

If you specify a value for the document field name that is not of type
``String`` such as a ``Document``, ``Array``, ``Number``, or ``null``,
the method does not execute and returns a ``TypeMismatch`` error with a
message that resembles the following:

.. blockquote::

   "key" had the wrong type. Expected string, found <non-string type>

Example
-------

The following snippet retrieves a list of distinct values for the ``year``
document field from the ``movies`` collection. It uses a query document to
match movies that include "Barbara Streisand" as a ``director``.
