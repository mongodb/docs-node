==================
Replace a Document
==================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can replace a single document using the `replaceOne()
<https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#replaceOne>`_
method. ``replaceOne()`` accepts a query document and a replacement
document, and fully replaces the first document that matches the query
with the provided replacement document. All fields and values in the
original document are removed with the exception of the ``_id`` value,
which remains the same unless you explicitly specify a new value for
``_id`` in the replacement document.

You can specify additional options, such as ``upsert``, using the
optional ``options`` parameter. Configuring the ``upsert`` field to
``true`` in the options object causes the operation to insert a new
document if no document matches the query.

The ``replaceOne()`` method returns a `Promise
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`_
that resolves to an `updateWriteOpResult
<https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#~updateWriteOpResult>`_
object. You can use the ``modifiedCount`` field of this
object to determine whether or not a document was modified. If the
operation was configured to upsert a document, the ``upsertedCount``
field indicates the number of newly inserted documents. Use the
``upsertedId._id`` field if you need a unique identifier for an upserted
document.

The ``replaceOne()`` method will throw an exception if an error occurs
during execution. For example, if you specify a value that violates a
unique index rule, ``replaceOne()`` throws a ``duplicate key error``.

.. note::

  If your application requires the document after updating,
  use the `collection.findOneAndReplace()
  <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#findOneAndReplace>`_
  method which has a similar interface to ``replaceOne()``.
  You can configure ``findOneAndReplace()`` to return either the
  original matched document or the replacement document.
