Create a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To create a document, define an object variable with the fields and values that you want to specify. You can insert this document into a collection using the `insertOne()
<https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#insertOne>`_
method. If the specified collection does not exist, the
``insertOne()`` method creates the collection. 

The ``insertOne()`` method returns a `Promise
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`_
that resolves to an object. The ``insertedId`` field of this object is
the ``_id`` of the inserted document. The ``insertedCount`` field of
this object has a value of 0 if a document was not created, and a value
of 1 if a document was created.
