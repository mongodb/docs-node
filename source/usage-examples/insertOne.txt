=================
Insert a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To insert a document, define an object variable with the fields and
values that you want to specify. You can insert this document into a
collection using the :node-api:`insertOne()
<Collection.html#insertOne>` method. If the specified collection
does not exist, the ``insertOne()`` method creates the collection.

The ``insertOne()`` method returns a :mdn:`Promise
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>` that resolves to an
object. The ``insertedId`` field of this object is the ``_id`` of the
inserted document. The ``insertedCount`` field of this object has a
value of ``0`` if a document was not created, and a value of ``1`` if a
document was created.
