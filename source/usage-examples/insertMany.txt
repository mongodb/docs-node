=====================
Create Many Documents
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can create multiple documents using the `insertMany()
<https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#insertMany>`_
method. The ``insertMany()`` takes an array of documents to insert into
the specified collection.

You can create an `Object
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>`_
to specify additional options. Specify ``ordered:true`` to prevent
inserting the remaining documents if the insertion failed for a previous
document in the array.

The ``insertMany()`` method returns a `Promise
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`_
that resolves to an object. The ``insertedIds`` field of this object is
an object that contains the ``_id`` of each inserted document. The
``insertedCount`` field of this object is the number of documents
inserted into the collection.

Specifying incorrect parameters for your ``insertMany()`` operation can
cause problems. Attempting to insert a field to a value that would violate
unique index rules will throw a ``duplicate key error``.
