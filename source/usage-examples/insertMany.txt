=========================
Insert Multiple Documents
=========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can insert multiple documents using the :node-api:`insertMany()
<Collection.html#insertMany>` method. The ``insertMany()`` takes an array
of documents to insert into the specified collection.

You can create an :mdn:`Object
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>` to specify additional
options. Specify ``ordered:true`` to prevent inserting the remaining
documents if the insertion failed for a previous document in the array.

The ``insertMany()`` method returns a :mdn:`Promise
<Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`
that resolves to an object. The ``insertedIds`` field of this object is
an object that contains the ``_id`` of each inserted document. The
``insertedCount`` field of this object is the number of documents
inserted into the collection.

Specifying incorrect parameters for your ``insertMany()`` operation can
cause problems. Attempting to insert a field to a value that would violate
unique index rules will throw a ``duplicate key error``.
