=====================
Create Many Documents
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can create multiple documents using the `insertMany()
<https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#insertMany>`_
method. The ``insertMany()`` method inserts multiple documents in the specified collection 
by taking in an array of documents. 

Create an `Object
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>`_
to specify additional options.  Set the ``bypassDocumentValidation`` field to bypass
:manual:`schema validation <core/schema-validation/>` rules in MongoDB 3.2 or higher. 
Specify ``ordered:true`` to prevent inserting the remaining documents if a 
previous document in the array fails to be inserted.

The ``insertMany()`` method returns a `Promise
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`_
that resolves to an object. The ``insertedIds`` field of this object is an object 
contains the ``_id`` of each inserted document. The ``insertedCount`` field of this object
contains the amount of documents inserted into the collection.

Specifying incorrect parameters for your ``insertMany()`` operation can
cause problems. Attempting to insert a field to a value that would violate
unique index rules will throw a ``duplicate key error``.
