Delete a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

.. note::
   If you specify a callback method, ``deleteOne()`` returns nothing. If you
   do not specify one, this method returns a ``Promise`` that resolves to the
   result object when it completes. See our guide on :doc:`Promises and
   Callbacks </fundamentals/promises>` for more information, or the
   `API documentation <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#deleteOne>`__ for
   information on the result object.

You can delete a single document in a collection with
``collection.deleteOne()``.
The ``deleteOne()`` method uses a query document that you provide
to match the subset of the documents in the collection that match
the query. If you do not provide a query document (or if you provide an
empty document), MongoDB matches all documents in the collection and
deletes the first match.

You can specify additional query options using the
``options`` object passed as the second parameter of the
``deleteOne`` method. You can also pass a
`callback method <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#deleteOne>`__
as an optional third parameter. For more information on this method,
see the
`deleteOne() API documentation <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#deleteOne>`__.

.. note::

  If your application requires the deleted document after deletion,
  consider using the
  `collection.findOneAndDelete() <{+api+}/classes/Collection.html#findOneAndDelete>`__.
  method, which has a similar interface to ``deleteOne()`` but also
  returns the deleted document.

Example
-------

The following snippet deletes a single document from the ``movies``
collection. It uses a **query document** that configures the query
to match movies with a ``title`` value of "Annie Hall".

.. note:: Identical Code Snippets

   The JavaScript and TypeScript code snippets above are identical. There are no
   TypeScript specific features of the driver relevant to this use case.

If you run the preceding example, you should see the following output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   Successfully deleted one document.

On subsequent runs of the preceding example, as you already deleted the document that
matched your query, you should see the following output:

.. code-block:: none
   :copyable: false

   No documents matched the query. Deleted 0 documents.
