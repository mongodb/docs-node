Delete a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can delete a single document in a collection with
``collection.deleteOne()``.
The ``deleteOne()`` method uses a query document that you provide
to match the subset of the documents in the collection that match
the query. If you do not provide a query document (or if you provide an
empty document), MongoDB matches all documents in the collection and
deletes the first match.

You can specify additional query options using the
``options`` object passed as the second parameter of the
``deleteOne`` method. You can also pass a
:node-api:`callback method <Collection.html#~deleteWriteOpCallback>`
as an optional third parameter. For detailed reference documentation,
see :node-api:`deleteOne() <Collection.html#deleteOne>`.

``deleteOne()`` behaves in two different ways depending on
whether you provide a callback method:

- if you do not specify a callback method, ``deleteOne()`` returns a
  :mdn:`Promise <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`
  that resolves to an object

- if you specify a callback method, ``deleteOne()`` returns
  nothing, and instead passes the result object or error object to the
  callback method

The :node-api:`result object
<Collection.html#~deleteWriteOpResult>`
contains several keys in the event of a successful execution. You can
use the ``deletedCount`` key to check the number of documents deleted by
the operation. Since ``deleteOne()`` can only delete a single document,
``deletedCount`` can have a value of either ``0`` or ``1``.

The error object contains ``errmsg``, a human-readable explanation of
what caused the operation to fail.

.. note::

  If your application requires the deleted document after deletion,
  consider using the
  :node-api:`collection.findOneAndDelete()
  <Collection.html#findOneAndDelete>`.
  method, which has a similar interface to ``deleteOne()`` but also
  returns the deleted document.

Example
-------

The following snippet deletes a single document from the ``movies``
collection. It uses a **query document** that configures the query
to match only movies with a title of type ``string``.
