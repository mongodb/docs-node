Delete a Document
=================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can delete a single document in a collection with
``collection.deleteOne()``.
The ``deleteOne()`` method uses a query document that you provide
to match only the subset of the documents in the collection that match
the query. If you don't provide a query document (or if you provide an
empty document), MongoDB matches all documents in the collection.
However, only the first matched document is deleted.

You can define additional query options using the
``options`` object passed as the second parameter of the
``deleteOne`` method. You can also pass a
:node-docs:`callback method <api/Collection.html#~deleteWriteOpCallback>`
as an optional third parameter. For detailed reference documentation, see
:node-docs:`collection.deleteOne() <api/Collection.html#deleteOne>`.

``deleteOne()`` behaves in two different ways depending on
whether or not a callback method is provided:

- if no callback method is provided, ``deleteOne()`` returns a
  :mdn:`Promise <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`
  that resolves to an
  :mdn:`Object <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object>`

- if a callback method is provided, ``deleteOne()`` returns
  nothing, and instead passes the result object or error object to the
  provided callback method

The :node-docs:`result object
<api/Collection.html#~deleteWriteOpResult>`
contains several keys in the event of a successful execution. You can
use the ``deletedCount`` key to check the number of documents deleted by
the operation. Since ``deleteOne()`` can only delete  a single document,
``deletedCount`` can only have a value of ``0`` or ``1``.

The error object contains ``errmsg``, a human-readable explanation of
what caused the operation to fail.

.. note::

  If your application requires the deleted document after deletion,
  consider using the
  :node-docs:`collection.findOneAndDelete()
  <api/Collection.html#findOneAndDelete>`.
  method, which has a similar interface to ``deleteOne()`` but also
  returns the deleted document.

Example
-------

The following snippet deletes a single document from the ``movies``
collection. It uses a **query document** that configures the query
to match only movies with a title of type ``string``.
