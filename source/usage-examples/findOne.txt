===============
Find a Document
===============

.. default-domain:: mongodb

You can
:manual:`query </tutorial/query-documents/#read-operations-query-argument>`
for a single document in a collection with ``collection.findOne()``.
The ``findOne()`` method uses a query document that you provide to match
only the subset of the documents in the collection that match the query.
If you don't provide a query document (or if you provide an empty document),
MongoDB matches all documents in the collection. However, the operation
only returns the first matched document.

You can also define additional query options such as
:doc:`sort </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/sort>`
and :doc:`projection </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/project>`
to configure the returned document. You can specify the additional options
in the ``options`` object passed as the second parameter of the
``findOne`` method. For detailed reference documentation, see
:node-api:`collection.findOne() <Collection.html#findOne>`.

``findOne()`` returns a
:mdn:`Promise <Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise>`
that resolves to an object which, if no documents match your query,
has a value of ``null``.

Example
-------

The following snippet find a single document from the ``movies``
collection. It uses the following:

- A **query document** that configures the query to return only
  movies with the title of exactly the text ``'The Room'``.

- A **sort** that organizes matched documents in ascending order by
  rating, so if our query matches multiple documents the returned
  document will be the document with the highest rating.

- A **projection** that explicitly excludes the ``_id`` field from
  returned documents and explicitly includes only the ``title`` and
  ``imdb`` object (and its embedded fields).
