Find Multiple Documents
=======================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can
`query <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/#read-operations-query-argument>`_
for multiple documents in a collection with ``collection.find()``.
The ``find()`` method uses a query document that you provide to match
only the subset of the documents in the collection that match the query.
If you don't provide a query document (or if you provide an empty document),
MongoDB returns all documents in the collection.


You can also define additional query options such as
`sort <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-type-comparison-order/index.html>`_
and
`projection <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results/>`_
to configure the result set. You should specify these options using the
cursor methods
`sort() <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Cursor.html#sort>`_
and
`project() <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Cursor.html#project>`_.
For detailed referenced documentation, see
`collection.find() <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Collection.html#find>`_.

``find()`` returns a
`Cursor <https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.3/api/Cursor.html>`_
that provides the results of your query. Iterate through the cursor
using cursor methods like ``next()``, ``toArray()``, or ``forEach()`` to
fetch and work with the returned documents. If no documents match the
query, ``find()`` returns an empty cursor.

Specify a Query
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``find()`` method allows you to look up items in a collection; the
query document allows you to make that search more specific.
Query documents contain one or more field-level expressions that
determine which documents to include in the result set. You can match
fields against literal values (e.g. ``{ title: 'The Room' }``) or
compose query operators to express more complex queries. MongoDB
supports multiple types of
`query operators <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/>`_,
including:

- `Comparison Operators <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query-comparison/>`_

- `Logical Operators <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query-logical/>`_

- `Element Operators <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query-element/>`_

- `Evaluation Operators <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query-evaluation/>`_

Consider a collection containing documents that describe an inventory of
fruit. To insert this data into a collection, run the following
operation:

.. code-block:: javascript

   await collection.insertMany([
     { "_id": 1, "name": "apples", "qty": 5, "rating": 3 },
     { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1 },
     { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 },
     { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados", "qty": 3, "rating": 5 },
   ]);

The following operation will search for documents with a
quantity value greater than 5 and print them out:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   // $gt means "greater than"
   const query = { qty: { $gt : 5 } };
   const cursor = collection.find(query);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

This will print out the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1 }
   { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 }

Specify a Sort
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use sort to change the order in which ``find()`` returns documents. Pass
the following sort to ``find()`` to ensure that the operation
returns fruit documents with higher ratings before fruit documents with
lower ratings:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   // define an empty query document
   const query = {};
   // sort in descending (-1) order by rating
   const sort = { rating: -1 };
   const cursor = collection.find(query).sort(sort);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

In this case, the number ``-1`` tells ``find()`` to sort the fruit in
descending order by rating, so the highest rated fruit comes first and
the lowest rated fruit comes last. ``find()`` returns the following
documents when this sort is used with an empty query:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados", "qty": 3, "rating": 5 }
   { "_id": 1, "name": "apples", "qty": 5, "rating": 3 }
   { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1 }


Rewriting this sort to use a value of
``1`` instead of a ``-1`` sorts our fruit in *ascending* order
by rating, so the lowest rated fruit comes first. If you do not
specify a sort, the order of documents returned is
`not guaranteed <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.sort/#result-ordering>`_.

Specify Which Fields to Return
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use a projection to control which fields ``find()`` includes in the
returned documents. Pass the following projection to only return the
names of the fruits:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   // define an empty query document
   const query = {}
   // return only* the name field
   const projection = { name: 1 }
   const cursor = collection.find(query).project(projection);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

``name`` has a value of ``1`` here to indicate that ``find`` should
*include* the ``name`` field of each document returned. Including any
field implicitly *excludes* any fields that aren't explicitly included
in the projection, so remember to specify any fields you want ``find()``
to return with a ``1``. Passing this projection to ``find`` with an
empty query and no sort order yields the following results:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 1, "name": "apples" }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas" }
   { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges" }
   { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados" }

Despite the fact that this projection only explicitly included the
``name`` field, the query returns the ``_id`` field as well! This
happens because the ``_id`` field is a special case: it is always
included in every query unless explicitly specified otherwise. That's
because ``_id`` is a unique identifier for each document, a property
that can be very useful when constructing queries. The ``movies``
collection is a good example of why this property is useful: because
remakes and even separate works can sometimes reuse movie titles, you
need a unique ``_id`` value to refer to any specific movie.

You can also explicitly *exclude* fields in your projections using a
value of ``0``. This works just like include: if you explicitly exclude,
all other fields are implicitly *included*. Keep in mind that, aside
from excluding ``_id`` while including other fields, you cannot use both
inclusive and exclusive statements in your projections.

Example
-------

The following snippet finds documents from the ``movies``
collection. It uses the following:

- A **query document** that configures the query to return only
  movies with a runtime of less than 15 minutes.

- A **sort** that organizes returned documents in ascending order by
  title (A->Z)

- A **projection** that explicitly excludes the ``_id`` field from
  returned documents and explicitly includes only the ``title`` and
  ``imdb`` object, which contains ``ratings``, ``votes``, and an ``id``.
