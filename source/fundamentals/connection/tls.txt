Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to connect to MongoDB instances with the
`TLS/SSL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`__
security protocol. To configure your connection to use TLS/SSL, enable
the TLS/SSL settings in either your connection string or the
`MongoClientOptions <{+api+}/interfaces/MongoClientOptions.html>`__
for your client.

.. important:: TLS vs. SSL
   
   TLS is the successor protocol to SSL, but the terms are often used
   interchangeably. Since TLS is an improved version of SSL, this guide
   describes how to connect to MongoDB with the TLS protocol.

.. _node-enable-tls:

Enable TLS
----------

You can enable TLS on a connection to your MongoDB instance
in the following ways:

- Setting the ``tls`` option to ``true`` in your connection string
- Setting the ``tls`` option to ``true`` in your ``MongoClientOptions``

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Connection String
      :tabid: connection string

      To enable TLS on a connection by using a connection string option,
      set the parameter ``tls`` as ``true`` in the connection string URI
      that you pass to the ``MongoClient`` constructor:

      .. code-block:: js
         :emphasize-lines: 1

         const uri = "mongodb://<hostname>:<port>?tls=true";
         const client = new MongoClient(uri, myClientSettings);

   .. tab:: MongoClientOptions
      :tabid: mongoclientoptions

      To enable TLS on a connection by using an option in a
      ``MongoClientOptions`` instance, set the property ``tls`` as
      ``true`` and pass the options to the ``MongoClient`` constructor:
      
      .. code-block:: js
         :emphasize-lines: 2

         var myClientSettings = {
           tls: true,
           ...
         };
         
         const client = new MongoClient(uri, myClientSettings);

.. _node-configure-tls-certificates:

Configure Certificates
----------------------

Applications that initiate TLS requests require access to
cryptographic certificates that prove the identity of the application
itself and other applications that the application
interacts with. To connect to MongoDB with TLS, your certificates must
be stored as ``PEM`` files, which are concatenated certificate
containers.

For production use, your MongoDB deployment should use valid certificates generated and
signed by the same certificate authority. For testing, you can
enable TLS with self-signed certificates.

Configure TLS Client Options
----------------------------

The driver provides client options that you can use to customize how you
enable TLS on a connection.

The following table describes the TLS client options that you can
specify to reference your certificates and connect to MongoDB with TLS
enabled. The first column describes Node.js options that you can specify
when creating a :ref:`SecureContext <node-tls-securecontext>`. The second column describes
equivalent driver client options, and the third column provides a
description of each option. The table entries include the expected value
type for each option.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 1 1 1

   * - Node.js Option
     - Driver Option
     - Description

   * - ``ca``, type: ``Buffer``
     - | ``tlsCAFile``, type: ``filepath string``
       | ``ca``, type: ``Buffer``
     - Specifies either a single or bundle of certificate authorities to
       trust when making a TLS connection.

   * - ``cert``, type: ``Buffer``
       | ``tlsCertificateFile``, type: ``filepath string``
       | ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``, type: ``filepath string``
       | ``cert``, type: ``Buffer``
     - Specifies the client certificate file or the client
       private key file.

   * - ``key``, type: ``Buffer``
     - | ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``, type: ``filepath string``
       | ``key``, type: ``Buffer``
     - Specifies the client private key file.

   * - ``passphrase``, type: ``string``
     - | ``tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword``, type: ``string``
     - Specifies the password to decrypt the client private key.

.. note:: Additional TLS Client Options
   
   For **testing purposes**, you can set the ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` and
   ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` options. Setting the
   ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` option to ``true`` disables hostname verification.
   Setting the ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` to ``true`` disables
   certificate validation and allows you to test a connection with an
   invalid certificate, such as a self-signed certificate.
   
   Specifying either of these options in a production environment puts
   your application at risk of becoming
   `insecure <https://tlseminar.github.io/docs/mostdangerous.pdf>`__ or
   vulnerable to expired certificates and to foreign processes posing
   as valid client instances.

For a full list of client options, see :ref:`node-connection-options`.

.. _node-client-tls-connect:

Reference Certificates in a Client
----------------------------------

You must reference your certificates in your ``MongoClientOptions`` so
that the Server can validate them before the client connects. The
driver provides multiple TLS-related client options to reference your
certificates. You can connect with the following option configurations:

- Passing a ``SecureContext`` object to the ``secureContext`` option *(Recommended)*
- Passing filepath strings to the ``tlsCAFile`` and
  ``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` options
- Passing ``Buffer`` objects that contain the contents of your
  certificates to the ``ca``, ``cert``, and ``key`` options

.. _node-tls-securecontext:

Create a ``SecureContext`` Object to Connect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend that you use the ``secureContext`` option to connect with
the TLS protocol. By using a ``SecureContext`` object to store your
certificates, you use the Node.js framework for TLS that is independent of the
driver. When you use this option, you keep all TLS options in a
reusable object. This is the most organized way to set up
TLS for your application.

To create a ``SecureContext`` object, you must first install the ``tls``
package and use it in your application. The ``tls.createSecureContext()``
method takes an options parameter that contains the contents of the
certificates. The ``secureContext`` option in your
``MongoClientOptions`` takes the ``SecureContext`` object as its value,
allowing the client to reference the certificates for validation.

The following code shows how to create a ``SecureContext`` object by
calling the ``tls.createSecureContext()`` method and set the
``secureContext`` client option:

.. code-block:: js
   :emphasize-lines: 2-6, 10
   
   // Create a SecureContext object
   var sc = tls.createSecureContext({
     ca: fs.readFileSync(`<path to CA certificate>`),
     cert: fs.readFileSync(`<path to client certificate>`),
     key: fs.readFileSync(`<path to client certificate>`),
   });
   
   // Pass the SecureContext as a client option
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
     secureContext: sc,
   });

To learn more about the ``tls.createSecureContext()`` method and the
``tls`` package, see the `Node.js TLS API documentation
<https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tlscreatesecurecontextoptions>`__.

To see a runnable example using the ``secureContext`` client option, see
the :ref:`SecureContext Example <node-securecontext-full-example>`.

Reference Certificate Filepaths to Connect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can reference the filepaths for your certificates as strings in your
client options to connect with TLS.

The following code shows how to specify the ``tlsCAFile`` and
``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` client options with certificate filepaths: 

.. code-block:: js
   :emphasize-lines: 3-4
   
   // Pass filepaths to client options
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
     tlsCAFile: `<path to CA certificate>`,
     tlsCertificateKeyFile: `<path to client certificate>`,
   });

Pass Certificate File Contents to Connect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can pass the contents of your certificate files as ``Buffer``
objects in your client options to connect with TLS.

The following code shows how to read the contents of your certificate
files and pass the resulting ``Buffer`` objects to the ``ca``, ``cert``, and
``key`` client options:

.. code-block:: js
   :emphasize-lines: 2-4, 8-10
   
   // Read file contents
   const ca = fs.readFileSync(`<path to CA certificate>`);
   const cert = fs.readFileSync(`<path to client certificate>`);
   const key = fs.readFileSync(`<path to client certificate>`);

   // Pass Buffers to client options
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
     ca: ca,
     cert: cert,
     key: key,
   });

.. _node-securecontext-full-example:

``SecureContext`` Example
-------------------------

This example shows how to create a ``SecureContext`` object and
a ``MongoClient`` instance that includes TLS options. The example
connects to MongoDB and executes a find query:

.. code-block:: js
   
   const { MongoClient } = require("mongodb");
   const fs = require("fs");
   const tls = require("tls");
   
   // Replace the uri string with your connection string.
   const uri = "<connection uri>";
   
   // Replace the filepaths with your certificate filepaths.
   var sc = tls.createSecureContext({
     ca: fs.readFileSync(`<path to CA certificate>`),
     cert: fs.readFileSync(`<path to client certificate>`),
     key: fs.readFileSync(`<path to client certificate>`),
   });
   
   const client = new MongoClient(uri, {
     tls: true,     
     secureContext: sc,
   });
   
   async function run() {
     try {
       const db = client.db("myDB");
       const myColl = database.collection("myColl");
       const doc = await myColl.findOne({});   
       console.log(doc);
     } finally {
       await client.close();
     }
   }
   run().catch(console.dir);
