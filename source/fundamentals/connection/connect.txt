This guide shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set
using the Node.js driver.

Connection URI
--------------

The **connection URI** is the set of instructions that the driver uses to
connect to a MongoDB deployment. It instructs the driver on how it should
connect to MongoDB and how it should behave while connected. The following
example shows each part of the connection URI:

.. figure:: /includes/figures/connection-string-parts.png
   :alt: Each part of the connection string

In this example, we use ``mongodb`` for the protocol, which specifies
the :manual:`Standard Connection String Format </reference/connection-string/#std-label-connections-standard-connection-string-format>`.

If your instance or deployment has a DNS SRV record, you can use the
:manual:`DNS Seed List Connection Format
</reference/connection-string/#dns-seed-list-connection-format>` for
your connection string. This format offers more flexibility of
deployment and the ability to change the servers in rotation without
reconfiguring clients.

.. note::

   To learn how to retrieve your connection string in Atlas, see the
   :atlas:`Atlas driver connection guide </driver-connection>`.

The next part of the connection string contains your username and password
if you are using password-based authentication. Replace the value of ``user``
with your username and ``pass`` with your password. If you are using an
authentication mechanism that does not require a username and password, omit
this part of the connection URI.

The next part of the connection string specifies the hostname or IP address and
port of your MongoDB instance. In the example above, we use ``sample.host``
as the hostname and ``27017`` as the port. Replace these values to point to
your MongoDB instance.

The last part of the connection string contains connection and authentication
options as parameters. In the example above, we set two connection options:
``maxPoolSize=20`` and ``w=majority``. For more information on connection
options, skip to the :ref:`node-connection-options` section.

Other Ways to Connect to MongoDB
--------------------------------

If you are connecting to a single MongoDB server instance or replica set
that is not hosted on Atlas, see the following sections to find out how to
connect.

Connect to a MongoDB Server on Your Local Machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. include:: /includes/localhost-connection.rst

To test whether you can connect to your server, replace the connection
string in the :ref:`Connect to MongoDB <connect-sample-node-driver>` code
example and run it.

Connect to a Replica Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A MongoDB replica set deployment is a group of connected instances that
store the same set of data. This configuration of instances provides data
redundancy and high data availability.

To connect to a replica set deployment, specify the hostname and port numbers
of each instance, separated by a comma, and the replica set name as the value
of the ``replicaSet`` parameter in the connection string.

.. code-block:: none

   mongodb://host1:27017,host2:27017,host3:27017/?replicaSet=myRs

When making a connection, the driver takes the following actions by default:

- Discovers all replica set members when given the address of any one member.
- Dispatches operations to the appropriate member, such as write against the **primary**.

.. tip:: Specify all hosts

   To ensure connectivity if one host is unavailable, provide the full
   list of hosts when connecting to a replica set.

Direct Connection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To force your operations to run on the host specified in your connection
URI, you can specify the ``directConnection`` connection option. If you
specify this option, you must use the standard connection URI format. The
driver does not accept the DNS seedlist connection format (SRV) when you
specify this option.

When you specify ``directConnection`` and connect to a secondary member of the
replica set, your write operations fail because the client isn't
connected to the primary member. To perform read operations, you must
enable secondary reads. See the :manual:`read preference options </reference/connection-string/#read-preference-options>`
for more information.
