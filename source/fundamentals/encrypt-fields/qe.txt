Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to configure the Node driver for {+qe+}.

For thorough coverage of the core concepts, use-cases, examples, and
reference, visit the main {+qe+} :ref:`documentation site <qe-manual-feature-qe>`.

Introduction
------------

{+qe+} allows you to encrypt specific data fields within a document before
sending the data to the server, and to query on encrypted fields. {+qe+}
is useful for situations in which applications must guarantee that
unauthorized parties, including server administrators, cannot read the
encrypted data.


Configuration
-------------

To use {+qe+}, you must:

- Configure the driver with specific settings for encryption.
- Configure and use the driver's encryption package, ``mongodb-client-encryption``.


MongoClient Configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

You must pass an ``AutoEncrytionOptions`` object to the ``MongoClient`` constructor
to enable {+qe+} operations with the {+driver-short+}.
