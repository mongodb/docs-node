Logging

.. important::

  The driver doesn't use the logger in versions 4.0 and later.
  Attempting to use prior logger settings in this version won't print
  anything in the log.
  
  Instead, see our monitoring guides:

  - :doc:`Command Monitoring </fundamentals/monitoring/command-monitoring>` 
  - :doc:`Cluster Monitoring </fundamentals/monitoring/cluster-monitoring>`

Temporary Alternative
---------------------

The Node.js team is currently working on rewriting the logger. In the
meantime, you can output monitor events using the following snippet:

.. code-block:: javascript

  const uri = "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?writeConcern=majority";
  const client = new MongoClient(uri, { monitorCommands:true });
  
  client.on('commandStarted', (event) => console.debug(event));
  client.on('commandSucceeded', (event) => console.debug(event));
  client.on('commandFailed', (event) => console.debug(event));
