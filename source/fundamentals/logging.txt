Logging

.. default-domain:: mongodb

   :local:
   :backlinks: none
   :depth: 1
   :class: singlecols

.. note::

  The driver doesn't use the logger in this version. Attempting to use
  prior settings in this version won't print anything. Instead, see our
  :doc:`command monitoring guide <monitoring/command-monitoring>`. 

Temporary Alternative
---------------------

The Node.js team is currently working on rewriting the logger. In the
meantime, you can log monitor events in the console using the following snippet:

.. code-block:: javascript

  const client = new MongoClient(CONNECTION_STRING, { monitorCommands:true });
  client.on('commandStarted', (ev) => console.debug(ev));
  client.on('commandSucceeded', (ev) => console.debug(ev));
  client.on('commandFailed', (ev) => console.debug(ev));
