Encrypt Fields

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Overview
--------

You can encrypt fields in a document using a feature called
**client-side encryption**.

Client-side encryption enables your client applications to encrypt data
*before* sending it to MongoDB, and to query documents for values in
encrypted fields.

Because the driver encrypts the data before sending it to MongoDB, only
your configured client applications can decrypt the data. People or
applications with access to your encryption keys are the only ones that
can see the decrypted, plaintext data. Should you have unauthorized access
to your database, and attacker would only see the encrypted version of the
fields you configured for encryption.

Client-side encryption is useful for storing sensitive data, such as:
- credit card numbers
- addresses
- health information
- financial information
- any other sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII)

MongoDB offers two ways to encrypt data:

{+qe+}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+qe+} is the next-generation client-side encryption feature from MongoDB,
introduced in MongoDB 6.0. {+qe+} supports searching encrypted fields
for equality and encrypts each value uniquely.

The MongoDB manual contains detailed information for {+qe+}:

- A :ref:`qe-quick-start`
- :ref:`qe-fundamentals`
- KMS :ref:`qe-tutorials`
- :ref:`qe-reference`

Client-side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Client-side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) supports searching encrypted values.
The core difference between CSFLE and {+qe+} is that CSFLE requires that
encrypted fields you want to search must be determinstically encrypted,
the same input produces the same output.

Fields that share common values between documents, such as gender or blood type,
may be subject to inference if an unauthorized party gained access to your data.

The MongoDB manual contains detailed information for CSFLE:

- A :ref:`csfle-quick-start`
- :ref:`csfle-fundamentals`
- KMS :ref:`csfle-tutorials`
- :ref:`csfle-reference`
