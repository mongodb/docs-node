In this guide, you can find sample code for connection to MongoDB with each
authentication mechanism available in the MongoDB Community Edition:
``DEFAULT``, ``SCRAM-SHA-256``, ``SCRAM-SHA-1``, ``MONGODB-CR``,
``MONGODB-AWS``, and ``X.509``.

``DEFAULT``
-----------

The ``DEFAULT`` authentication mechanism is a fallback setting that instructs
the driver to negotiate the first authentication mechanism supported by the
server in the following order of preference:

#. ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
#. ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
#. ``MONGODB-CR``

If the ``DEFAULT`` option is specified, the driver first attempts to
authenticate using ``SCRAM-SHA-256``. If the version of the MongoDB instance
does not support that mechanism, the driver attempts to authenticate using
``SCRAM-SHA-1``. If the instance does not support that mechanism either,
the driver attempts to authenticate using ``MONGODB-CR``.

You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the ``authMechanism``
parameter to ``DEFAULT`` in the
:manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>`, or by omitting
the parameter since it is the default value. Also include your username and
password as shown in the code below.

.. important::
   Always **URI encode** the username and password using the
   ``encodeURIComponent`` method to ensure they are correctly parsed.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/default.js
   :language: javascript

For more information on the challenge-response (CR) and salted
challenge-response authentication mechanisms (SCRAM) that MongoDB supports,
see the :manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram/>` section of the manual.

``SCRAM-SHA-256``
-----------------

.. note::

   ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` is the default authentication method for MongoDB starting
   in version 4.0

``SCRAM-SHA-256`` is a salted challenge-response authentication mechanism
(SCRAM) that uses your username and password, encrypted with the ``SHA-256``
algorithm to authenticate your user.

You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the ``authMechanism``
to the value ``SCRAM-SHA-256`` in the
:manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` as shown in the
following sample code.

.. important::
   Always **URI encode** the username and password using the
   ``encodeURIComponent`` method to ensure they are correctly parsed.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/sha256.js
   :language: javascript

``SCRAM-SHA-1``
---------------

.. note::
   ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is the default authentication method for MongoDB versions
   3.0, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6.

``SCRAM-SHA-1`` is a salted challenge-response mechanism (SCRAM) that uses your
username and password, encrypted with the ``SHA-1`` algorithm to authenticate
your user.

You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the ``authMechanism``
parameter to the value ``SCRAM-SHA-1`` in the
:manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` as shown
in the following sample code.

.. important::
   Always **URI encode** the username and password using the
   ``encodeURIComponent`` method to ensure they are correctly parsed.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/sha1.js
   :language: javascript

``MONGODB-CR``
--------------

.. warning::
   MONGODB-CR was deprecated starting in MongoDB 3.6, and is no longer supported as of MongoDB 4.0

``MONGODB-CR`` is a challenge-response authentication mechanism that uses your
username and password to authenticate your user.

You can specify this option by setting the ``authMechanism`` parameter to value
``MONGODB-CR`` in the
:manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>` as shown
in the following sample code.

.. important::
   Always **URI encode** the username and password using the
   ``encodeURIComponent`` method to ensure they are correctly parsed.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/cr.js
   :language: javascript

.. important::
   If you have :manual:`upgraded the authentication schema from MONGODB-CR to
   SCRAM </release-notes/3.0-scram/>`, any ``MONGODB-CR`` user
   authentication requests fail.

.. _mongodb-aws: 

``MONGODB-AWS``
---------------

.. note::
   The MONGODB-AWS authentication mechanism is only available in MongoDB
   versions 4.4 and later.

The ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism uses your Amazon Web Services
Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) credentials to authenticate your
user.

To connect to a MongoDB instance with ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication
enabled, specify the ``MONGODB-AWS`` authentication mechanism and pass
your ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` credentials to the
driver when you attempt to connect. If your AWS login requires a session
token, you must include your ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` as well.

The driver checks the following sources for your credentials in order:

1. Connection string
2. Environment variables
3. AWS ECS endpoint specified in ``AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI``
4. AWS EC2 endpoint. For more information, see `IAM Roles for Tasks
   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html>`_.

If you do not already have the `AWS signature library <https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws4>`__,
install it using the following ``npm`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   npm install aws4

The following code shows an example of specifying the ``MONGODB-AWS``
authentication mechanism and credentials in the connection string:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/aws.js
   :language: javascript

``X.509``
---------

.. note::
   The X.509 authentication mechanism is only available in MongoDB versions
   2.6 and later.

The ``X.509`` authentication mechanism uses
:wikipedia:`TLS <Transport_Layer_Security>` with X.509 certificates to
authenticate your user, identified by the distinguished name (DN) of your
client certificate. For more information on determining the *subject* name from
the X.509 certificate, see the MongoDB manual :manual:`X.509 tutorial
</tutorial/configure-x509-client-authentication/#add-x-509-certificate-subject-as-a-user>`.

You can specify this authentication mechanism by setting the following
parameters of your
:manual:`connection string </reference/connection-string/>`:

- Set the ``authMechanism`` parameter to the value ``MONGODB-X509``
- Set the ``tls`` parameter to the value ``true``

Pass the location of your client certificate file as the value of
``tlsCertificateKeyFile`` as a parameter of the connection URI.

.. important::
   Always **URI encode** the username and certificate file path using the
   ``encodeURIComponent`` method to ensure they are correctly parsed.

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/authentication/x509.js
   :language: javascript

TLS/SSL Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes each of the TLS/SSL options that can be passed
as a parameter in the connection URI.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 35 12 10 43
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter Name
     - Type
     - Default Value
     - Description

   * - ``tls``
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether to use TLS/SSL connections.

   * - ``tlsInsecure``
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     -  Specifies whether to allow invalid certificates and mismatched
        hostnames. When set to ``true``, this is equivalent to setting
        ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` and ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` to
        ``true``.

   * - ``tlsCAFile``
     - string
     -

       authorities used in a TLS connection.

   * - ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``
     - string
     -
     - Path to the client certificate file or the client private key file. If
       both are required, the two must be concatenated into a single file.

   * - ``tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword``
     - buffer or string
     -
     - String or buffer that contains the password to decrypt the client
       private key.

   * - ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates``
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether the driver permits an invalid certificate to be used
       to connect.

   * - ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames``
     - boolean
     - ``false``
     - Specifies whether the driver should permit a mismatch between the
       server hostname and TLS certificate hostname.
