Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about time series collections in the MongoDB
Node.js driver. 

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

We recommend that you create a time series collection using the MongoDB Shell
({+mongosh+}). For detailed instructions on creating a time series collection
using the MongoDB Shell, see our
:manual:`MongoDB Manual entry on time series collections </core/timeseries-collections/#create-a-time-series-collection>`.

.. .. important:: Use the MongoDB Shell For Administrative Commands
.. 
..    You should not use the Node.js driver to perform administrative commands on
..    your MongoDB deployment. Use the MongoDB Shell to perform administrative
..    commands, such as:
..    
..    - :manual:`Create a collection </reference/method/db.createCollection/#mongodb-method-db.createCollection>`
..    - :manual:`Create a user </reference/method/db.createUser/#mongodb-method-db.createUser>`
..    - :manual:`Manage access </reference/method/db.grantRolesToUser/#mongodb-method-db.grantRolesToUser>`

Query a Time Series Collection
------------------------------

Since you query a time series collection in the same way you query other
collection types in MongoDB, the Node.js driver has no features specifically for
querying time series data.

For more information on querying data in the MongoDB Node.js driver, see the
following resources:

- :ref:`Guide On Read Operations <nodejs-driver-retrieve-data-overview>`
- :ref:`Guide On Aggregation <nodejs-aggregation-overview>`

.. note:: Window Functions

   MongoDB version 5.0 introduces window functions into the MongoDB aggregation
   framework. You can use window functions to perform operations on a
   contiguous span of time series data. For more information, see 
   :manual:`the reference documentation for the $setWindowFields aggregation stage </reference/operator/aggregation/setWindowFields/#-setwindowfields--aggregation->`.
