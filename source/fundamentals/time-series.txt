Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn about time series collections in the MongoDB
Node.js driver. 

Create a Time Series Collection
-------------------------------

You should create a time series collection using the MongoDB Shell. For detailed
instructions on creating a time series collection using the MongoDB Shell, see our
:ref:`MongoDB Manual entry on time series collections <manual-timeseries-collection-create>`.

.. important:: Use the MongoDB Shell For Administrative Commands

   You should not use the Node.js driver to perform administrative commands on
   your MongoDB deployment. Use the MongoDB Shell to perform administrative
   commands including but not limited to:
   
   - :manual:`Create a collection </reference/method/db.createCollection/#mongodb-method-db.createCollection>`
   - :manual:`Create a user </reference/method/db.createUser/#mongodb-method-db.createUser>`
   - :manual:`Manage access </reference/method/db.grantRolesToUser/#mongodb-method-db.grantRolesToUser>`

Query a Time Series Collection
------------------------------

You query a time series collection in the same way you query other
collection types in MongoDB. The Node.js driver has no features specifically for
querying time series data.

For more information on querying data in the MongoDB Node.js driver, see the
following resources:

- :ref:`Guide On Read Operations <nodejs-driver-retrieve-data-overview>`
- :ref:`Guide On Aggregations <nodejs-aggregation-overview>`
