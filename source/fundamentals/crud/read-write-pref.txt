Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to modify the way that the {+driver-long+} executes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations using **write concern**, **read concern**, and **read preference** configurations for replica sets.

You can set write concern, read concern, and read preference options at
the following levels:

- Client level, which sets the *default for all operation executions*
  unless overridden
- Session level
- Transaction level
- Database level
- Collection level

These options allow you to customize the consistency and availability of the data in your replica sets.

Write Concern
-------------

A write concern describes the level of acknowledgement requested from MongoDB for write operations, such as an insert or update, before the operation is returned as successful. 
Operations which do not specify an explicit write concern inherit the global default write concern settings.

For more information, see :manual:`Write Concern </reference/write-concern/>`

Constructor
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: js

   new WriteConcern(w?, wtimeoutMS?, journal?): WriteConcern

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Parameter
     - Description
  
   * - ``w`` *(optional)*
     - | request acknowledgment that the write operation has propagated to a specified number of mongod instances or to mongod instances with specified tags 
       | **Type:** W ***************** https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/5.7/types/W.html ?

   *  - ``wtimeoutMS`` *(optional)*
      - | specify a time limit to prevent write operations from blocking indefinitely
        | **Type:** number

   * - ``journal`` *(optional)*
     - | request acknowledgment that the write operation has been written to the on-disk journal
       | **Type:** boolean


Methods
~~~~~~~

``apply``
`````````
Adds a new write concern to a command document.

.. code-block:: js

   apply(command, writeConcern): Document

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 75

   * - Parameter
     - Description

   * - ``command``
     - | **Type:** Document

   * - ``writeConcern``
     - | **Type:** WriteConcern

Update a ``WriteConcern`` for an existing document
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This code updates the write concern of an existing document:

.. code-block:: js

   document = {}
   writeConcern = new WriteConcern(2, 30, true)
   WriteConcern.apply(document, writeConcern)


.. important::
   
   Use the ``fromOptions`` method to construct a ``WriteConcern`` from an existing set of options or ``WriteConcern``:

   .. code-block:: js

      WriteConcern.fromOptions(options)


Read Concern
------------

The read concern determines which data the client returns from a query. The default read concern level is 
"local", meaning that the client returns the instanceâ€™s most recent data, with no guarantee that the data 
has been written to a majority of the replica set members.
