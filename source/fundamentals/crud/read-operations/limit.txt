Overview
--------

Use ``limit`` to cap the number of documents that can be returned from a
read operation. ``limit`` functions as a cap on the maximum number of
documents that the operation can return, but the operation can return
a smaller number of documents if there are not enough documents present
to reach the limit. If ``limit`` is used with the
:doc:`skip </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/skip>` method, the skip applies
first and the limit only applies to the documents left over after
the skip.

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the instructions in the examples below to insert data into
a collection and return only certain results from a query using a sort,
a skip, and a limit. Consider the following collection of documents that
describe books:

.. code-block:: javascript

   [
     { "_id": 1, "name": "The Brothers Karamazov", "author": "Dostoyevsky", "length": 824 },
     { "_id": 2, "name": "Les Misérables", "author": "Hugo", "length": 1462 },
     { "_id": 3, "name": "Atlas Shrugged", "author": "Rand", "length": 1088 },
     { "_id": 4, "name": "Infinite Jest", "author": "Wallace", "length": 1104 },
     { "_id": 5, "name": "Cryptonomicon", "author": "Stephenson", "length": 918 },
     { "_id": 6, "name": "A Dance With Dragons", "author": "Tolkein", "length": 1104 },
   ]

Limit
-----

The following example queries the collection to return the top three
longest books. It matches all the documents with the query, applies
a ``sort`` on the ``length`` field to return books with longer lengths before
books, and applies a ``limit`` to return only ``3`` results:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   // define an empty query document
   const query = {};
   // sort in descending (-1) order by length
   const sort = { length: -1 };
   const limit = 3;
   const cursor = collection.find(query).sort(sort).limit(limit);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

The code example above outputs the following three documents, sorted by
length:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 2, "title": "Les Misérables", "author": "Hugo", "length": 1462 }
   { "_id": 6, "title": "A Dance With Dragons", "author": "Martin", "length": 1104 }
   { "_id": 4, "title": "Infinite Jest", "author": "Wallace", "length": 1104 }

.. note::

   The order in which you call ``limit`` and ``sort`` does not matter
   because the driver reorders the calls to apply the sort first and the
   limit after it. The following two calls are equivalent:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      collection.find(query).sort({ length: -1 }).limit(3);
      collection.find(query).limit(3).sort({ length: -1 });

You can also apply ``sort`` and ``limit`` by specifying them in an
``options`` object in your call to the ``find()`` method. The following two
calls are equivalent:

.. code-block:: javascript

   collection.find(query).sort({ length: -1 }).limit(3);
   collection.find(query, { sort: { length: -1 }, limit: 3 });

For more information on the ``options`` settings for the ``find()``
method, see the
:node-api-3.6:`API documentation on find() <Collection.html#find>`.

Skip
----

To see the next three books in the results, append the ``skip()`` method,
passing the number of documents to bypass as shown below:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 6,7

   // define an empty query document
   const query = {};
   // sort in descending (-1) order by length
   const sort = { length: -1 };
   const limit = 3;
   const skip = 3;
   const cursor = collection.find(query).sort(sort).limit(limit).skip(skip);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

This operation returns the documents that describe the fourth through sixth
books in order of longest-to-shortest length:

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "_id": 3, "title": "Atlas Shrugged", "author": "Rand", "length": 1088 }
   { "_id": 5, "title": "Cryptonomicon", "author": "Stephenson", "length": 918 }
   { "_id": 1, "title": "The Brothers Karamazov", "author": "Dostoyevsky", "length": 824 }

You can combine skip and limit in this way to implement paging for your
collection, returning only small "slices" of the collection at once.
