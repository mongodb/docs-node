Overview
--------

Use ``skip`` to omit documents from the beginning of the list of
returned documents for a read operation. You can combine ``skip`` with
:doc:`sort </fundamentals/crud/read-operations/sort>` to omit the top
(for descending order) or bottom (for ascending order) results for a
given query. Since the :manual:`order of documents returned
</reference/method/cursor.sort/#result-ordering>` is not guaranteed in
the absence of a sort, using ``skip`` without using ``sort`` omits
arbitrary documents.

If the value of ``skip`` exceeds the number of matched documents for
a query, that query returns no documents.

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the instructions in the examples below to insert data into
a collection and perform a sort and skip on the results of a query.
Consider a collection containing documents that describe varieties of
fruit:

.. code-block:: json

   [
      { "_id": 1, "name": "apples", "qty": 5, "rating": 3 },
      { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1 },
      { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 },
      { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados", "qty": 3, "rating": 5 },
   ]

.. include:: /includes/access-cursor-note.rst

Example
-------

In the following example, we query the collection with a filter that
matches all the documents and pass options that specifies ``sort`` and
``skip`` commands as query options. The sort option specifies that fruit
documents with higher ratings should be returned before ones with lower
ratings. The skip option specifies that the first 2 documents should be
omitted from the result:

.. code-block:: javascript

   // define an empty query document
   const query = {};
   const options = {
      // sort in descending (-1) order by rating
      sort : { rating: -1 },
      // omit the first two documents
      skip : 2,
   }

   const cursor = collection.find(query, options);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

Since we specified that the first ``2`` documents should be skipped, the
third and fourth highest rating documents are printed by the code snippet
above:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1 }


The ``sort`` and ``skip`` options can also be specified as methods chained to
the ``find`` method. The following two commands are equivalent:

.. code-block:: javascript

   collection.find(query, { sort: { rating: -1}, skip: 2});
   collection.find(query).sort({rating: -1}).skip(2);
