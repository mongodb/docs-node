Overview
--------

Use a projection to control which fields appear in the documents
returned by read operations. Many requests only require certain fields,
so projections can help you limit unnecessary network bandwidth usage.
Projections work in two ways:

- Explicitly include fields with a value of ``1``. This has the
  side-effect of implicitly excluding all unspecified fields.

- Implicitly exclude fields with a value of ``0``. This has the
  side-effect of implicitly including all unspecified fields.

These two methods of projection are mutually exclusive: if you
explicitly include fields, you cannot explicitly exclude fields, and
vice versa.

Sample Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the following collection containing documents that describe
varieties of fruit:

.. code-block:: json

   [
     { "_id": 1, "name": "apples", "qty": 5, "rating": 3 },
     { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas", "qty": 7, "rating": 1 },
     { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges", "qty": 6, "rating": 2 },
     { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados", "qty": 3, "rating": 5 },
   ]

.. include:: /includes/access-cursor-note.rst

Single Field
------------

In the following query, pass the projection to only return the ``name``
field of each document:

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   // return only* the name field
   const projection = { name: 1 };
   const cursor = collection.find().project(projection);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

The projection document specifies a value of ``1`` for ``name`` to
indicate that the read operation result should *include* the ``name``
field of each returned document. As a result, this projection implicitly
excludes the ``qty`` and ``rating`` fields. Passing this projection to
``find()`` with an empty query document and no sort document yields
the following results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "_id": 1, "name": "apples" }
   { "_id": 2, "name": "bananas" }
   { "_id": 3, "name": "oranges" }
   { "_id": 4, "name": "avocados" }

Despite the fact that this projection only explicitly included the
``name`` field, the query returned the ``_id`` field as well!

This happens because the ``_id`` field is a special case: it is always
included in every query unless explicitly specified otherwise. That's
because ``_id`` is a unique identifier for each document, a property
that can be very useful when constructing queries. The ``movies``
collection is a good example of why this property is useful: because
remakes and even separate works can sometimes reuse movie titles, you
need a unique ``_id`` value to refer to any specific movie. ``_id`` is
the only exception to the mutually exclusive include-exclude behavior in
projections: you *can* explicitly exclude ``_id`` even when explicitly
including other fields if you do not want ``_id`` to be present in
returned documents.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   // return only the name field
   const projection = { _id: 0, name: 1 };
   const cursor = collection.find().project(projection);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

The projection document specifies a value of ``1`` for ``name`` to
indicate that the read operation result should *include* the ``name``
field of each returned document. As a result, this projection implicitly
excludes the ``qty`` and ``rating`` fields. Passing this projection to
``find()`` with an empty query document and no sort document yields
the following results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

   { "name": "apples" }
   { "name": "bananas" }
   { "name": "oranges" }
   { "name": "avocados" }

Multiple Fields
---------------

You can also specify multiple fields to include in your projection. Note: the
order in which you specify the fields in the projection does not alter the
order in which they are returned.

.. code-block:: javascript

   const projection = { _id: 0, rating: 1, name: 1 };
   const cursor = collection.find().project(projection);
   await cursor.forEach(console.dir);

This example that identifies two fields to include in the projection yields
the following results:

.. code-block:: json
   :copyable: false

     { "name": "apples", "rating": 3 }
     { "name": "bananas", "rating": 1 }
     { "name": "oranges", "rating": 2 }
     { "name": "avocados", "rating": 5 }
