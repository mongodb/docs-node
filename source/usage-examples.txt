.. default-domain:: mongodb

- :doc:`Find Operations </usage-examples/find>`

- :doc:`Insert Operations </usage-examples/insert>`

- :doc:`Update Operations </usage-examples/update>`

- :doc:`Replace Operations </usage-examples/replace>`

- :doc:`Delete Operations </usage-examples/delete>`

- :doc:`Count Documents </usage-examples/count>`

- :doc:`Retrieve Distinct Values of  Field </usage-examples/distinct>`

- :doc:`Run a Command </usage-examples/command>`

- :doc:`Perform Bulk Operations </usage-examples/bulkWrite>`


Usage examples provide convenient starting points for popular MongoDB
operations. In each example you will find:

- an explanation of the operation in the example that explains the
  purpose of the method

- an explanation of how to use the operation, including parameters,
  return values, and common exceptions you might encounter

- a full Node.js program that you can copy and paste to run the example
  in your own environment

How to Use the Usage Examples
-----------------------------

All of the examples use the :atlas:`MongoDB Atlas sample data
<sample-data>` database. You can use this sample data on the free tier
of MongoDB Atlas by following the :atlas:`Get Started with Atlas
<getting-started/#atlas-getting-started>` guide or you can
:manual:`import the sample dataset into a local MongoDB instance
</import/>`.

Once you have imported the dataset, just copy and paste a usage example
into a file on your computer. You can follow the
:doc:`quick start guide </quick-start` to learn more about getting
Node.js, npm, and the Node.js driver running locally. Once you've copied
a usage example, you'll have to edit one line to get the example running
with your instance of mongodb.

.. code-block:: javascript

   // Replace the following with your MongoDB deployment's connection
   // string.
   const uri =
      "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>?retryWrites=true&w=majority";

You can use the :guides:`Atlas Connectivity Guide
</cloud/connectionstring/>` to enable connectivity to your instance of
Atlas and find the :manual:`connection string
</reference/connection-string/>` to replace the ``uri`` variable in the
usage example. If your instance uses :manual:`SCRAM authentication
</core/security-scram/>`, you can replace ``<user>`` with your username,
``<password>`` with your password, and ``<cluster-url>`` with the IP
address or URL of your instance. Consult the :doc:`authentication guide
</fundamentals/authentication>` for more information about getting
connected to your MongoDB instance.
