Overview
--------

Aggregation tutorials provide detailed explanations of common
aggregation tasks in a step-by-step format. The tutorials are adapted
from examples in the `Practical MongoDB Aggregations book
<https://www.practical-mongodb-aggregations.com/>`__ by Paul Done.

Each tutorial includes the following sections:

1. Introduction, which describes the purpose and common use cases of the
   aggregation type. This section also describes the example and desired
   outcome that the tutorial demonstrates.

#. Before You Get Started, which describes the necessary databases,
   collections, and sample data that you must insert before building the
   aggregation pipeline and performing the aggregation.

#. Aggregation Tutorial, which describes how to build and run the aggregation
   pipeline. This section describes each stage of the completed
   aggregation tutorial, and then explains how to run and interpret the
   output of the aggregation.

At the end of each aggregation tutorial, you can find a link to a fully
runnable Node.js code file that you can run in your environment.

Aggregation Template App
------------------------

Before you begin following an aggregation tutorial, set up an app that
you can use to insert sample data into MongoDB and run the aggregation
pipeline.

.. tip:: 
   
   To learn how to install the driver and connect to MongoDB,
   see the :ref:`node-quick-start-download-and-install` and
   :ref:`node-quick-start-create-deployment` steps of the
   Quick Start guide.

Once you install the driver, create a file called
``aggregation.js``.
