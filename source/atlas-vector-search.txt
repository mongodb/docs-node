Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use the :atlas:`Atlas Vector Search
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>` feature
in the {+driver-short+}. 

You can use {+vector-search+} to perform a vector search on your data stored in
Atlas. Vector search allows you to query your data based on semantic meaning
rather than just keyword matches, which helps you retrieve more relevant search
results. It enables your AI-powered applications to support use cases such as
semantic search, hybrid search, and generative search, including
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

To learn more about {+vector-search+}, see the :atlas:`{+vector-search+}
</atlas-vector-search/vector-search-overview/>` guide in the MongoDB Atlas
documentation.

.. important:: Feature Compatibility

   To learn what versions of MongoDB Atlas support this feature, see
   :atlas:`Limitations </atlas-vector-search/vector-search-stage/#limitations>`
   in the MongoDB Atlas documentation.

Perform a Vector Search
-----------------------

To use this feature, you must create a vector search index and index your
vector embeddings. To learn about how to programmatically create a
vector search index, see the :atlas:`Create an Atlas Vector Search index
<atlas-vector-search/vector-search-type/#create-an-atlas-vector-search-index>` section in the
Atlas documentation. To learn more about vector embeddings, see
:atlas:`How to Index Vector Embeddings for Vector Search
<atlas-vector-search/create-embeddings/>` in the Atlas documentation.

After you create a vector search index on your vector embeddings, you
can reference this index in your pipeline stage, as shown in the
following section.

Sample Data
-----------

The example on this page shows how to build an aggregation pipeline that uses the
``$vectorSearch`` stage to perform an exact vector search on the
``sample_mflix.embedded_movies`` collection in the :atlas:`Atlas sample datasets
</sample-data>`.

To learn how to create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and load the sample datasets, see the
:atlas:`Get Started with Atlas </getting-started>` guide.

Vector Search Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can perform a vector search query by using the ``$vectorSearch`` stage
in an :ref:`aggregation pipeline <node-aggregation>`. To perform a vector
search on a collection, you must first have a collection with a field that contains
vector embeddings and a vector search index that covers that field. 

The aggregation pipeline searches  the ``plot``  field of each document in the collection
for text semantically related to the term "time travel". The ``queryVector`` field in the
``$vectorSearch`` pipeline is the vector representation of your query.

This query uses the ``$vectorSearch`` stage to:

- Search for the specified term in the``plot_embedding`` field

- Set the number of nearest neighbors used in the search to 150 by using the ``numCandidates`` option

It uses the ``$project`` stage to:

- Only include the movie ``plot`` and ``title`` fields in the results.

- Add a ``score`` field to show the relevance of each result to the search term.
