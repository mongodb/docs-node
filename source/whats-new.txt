.. _version-4.0:

What's New in 4.0
-----------------

New features of the 4.0 Node.js driver release include:

TypeScript
~~~~~~~~~~

- We've migrated the driver to TypeScript. You can now harness the type
  hinting and intellisense features in editors that support it to develop
  your MongoDB applications. You do not have to adopt TypeScript to get
  the benefits of this work.

- The underlying BSON library used by this version has been migrated to
  TypeScript.

- Inline documentation has been consistenly formatted to improve display
  in editors.

- If you are a user of the community types (``@types/mongodb``), there will
  **likely be issues** adopting the types from our codebase. We could not
  achieve a one to one match in types due to the details of writing the
  codebase in TypeScript. A notable difference is that CRUD API
  functions do not support interfaces via generics. The following example
  illustrats the difference:

  .. code-block:: ts
     :copyable: False

     interface User { name: string, age: number }
     const user = await collection.findOne<User>()
     user // has type User when using @types/mongodb
     user // has type Document when using 'mongodb' types

  Any operation dealing with documents return our Document type, which is
  equivalent to ``Record<string, any>``. Code shouldn't fail to compile, but will
  not be type checked as desired.






.. _version-3.6:

What's New in 3.6
-----------------

New features of the 3.6 Node.js driver release include:

- Added support for the :ref:`MONGODB-AWS <mongodb-aws>` authentication mechanism using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials
- Added support for Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)
- The :node-api-4.0:`find()</classes/collection.html#find>` method supports ``allowDiskUse()`` for sorts that require too much memory to execute in RAM
- The :ref:`update() <updateDocuments>` and :ref:`replaceOne() <replacementDocument>` methods support index hints
- A reduction in recovery time for topology changes and failover events
- Improvements in validation testing for the default :manual:`writeConcern </reference/write-concern/>`
- Authentication requires fewer round trips to the server, resulting in faster connection setup
- Shorter Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (:manual:`SCRAM </core/security-scram/>`) conversations
- Ability to create collections and indexes for multiple document transactions
- Running validation for a collection in the background
