Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to use {+driver-short+} to perform a replace
operation on a document in a MongoDB collection. A replace operation performs
differently than an update operation. An update operation
modifies only the specified fields in a target document. A replace operation removes *all* fields
in the target document and replaces them with new ones.
