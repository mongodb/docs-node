===========================
Update Arrays in a Document
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Sometimes you need to modify arrays within a document. ``arrayFilters``,
a collection of variables indicating positions in arrays, allows this
kind of operation. Use the
`filtered position operator
<https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/update/positional-filtered/index.html>`_
to access the values of the variables stored within ``arrayFilters``,
which represent positions in an array that match query filter
criteria.

Example

Consider a collection of finalists in hot dog eating contests by year:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      {
         year: 1989,
         finalists: [
            "Steve Jobs",
            "Ford Anglia",
            "Beth Atkins",
         ]
      },
      {
         year: 1990,
         finalists: [
            "Cat Stevens",
            "Reggie Mole",
            "Anis Kollal",
         ]
      }
      {
         year: 1991,
         finalists: [
            "Steve Jobs",
            "Cat Stevens",
            "Beth Atkins",
         ]
      }
   }

If "Steve Jobs" changed his name, and we wanted to update his name in
multiple arrays across years, we could use ``arrayFilters``. See below.
