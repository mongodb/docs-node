===========================
Update Arrays in a Document
===========================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

To modify arrays embedded within a document, use the
:manual:`filtered positional operator
</reference/operator/update/positional-filtered/index.html>`. You can
use this operator in an :doc:`update document
</crud/write-operations/update-document` to modify specific elements in
an array. The operator determines which elements to modify based on a
query filter that you define in the ``arrayFilters`` option.

You can think of ``arrayFilters`` as an subquery applied
only to documents already matched by the update operation's query filter
(the first parameter for ``updateOne()`` and ``updateMany()``). This
query finds all positions in the referenced array that match your
criteria, and you can use the returned position values to modify only
those positions.

Example
~~~~~~~

The following example demonstrates how you can use the filtered
position operator with ``arrayFilters`` to modify only specific
elements of arrays embedded within documents matched by the query.
Consider a pizza shop's order collection containing the following order:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      name: "Steve Lobsters",
      address: "731 Yexington Avenue",
      items: [
        {
          type: "pizza",
          size: "large",
          toppings: ["pepperoni"],
        },
        {
          type: "pizza",
          size: "medium",
          toppings: ["mushrooms", "sausage", "green peppers"],
          comment: "Extra green peppers please!",
        },
        {
          type: "pizza",
          size: "large",
          toppings: ["pineapple, ham"],
          comment: "red pepper flakes on top",
        },
        {
          type: "calzone",
          fillings: ["canadian bacon", "sausage", "onion"],
        },
        {
          type: "beverage",
          name: "Diet Pepsi",
          size: "16oz",
        },
      ],
    }

If the customer calls back a few minutes later to adjust their order,
the pizza shop can use the filtered positional operator to update only
certain ``items`` in the order that match criteria specified in
``arrayFilters``. In this case, the shop needs to add salami to *only*
the large pepperoni pizza in Steve Lobsters' order:

.. literalinclude:: /code-snippets/crud/arrayFilters.js
   :language: javascript
   :start-after: start arrayFilters example
   :end-before: end arrayFilters example
   :dedent: 4

This operation produces the following modified order:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      name: "Steve Lobsters",
      address: "731 Yexington Avenue",
      items: [
        {
          type: "pizza",
          size: "large",
          toppings: ["pepperoni", "salami"],
        },
        {
          type: "pizza",
          size: "medium",
          toppings: ["mushrooms", "sausage", "green peppers"],
          comment: "Extra green peppers please!",
        },
        {
          type: "pizza",
          size: "large",
          toppings: ["pineapple, ham"],
          comment: "red pepper flakes on top",
        },
        {
          type: "calzone",
          fillings: ["canadian bacon", "sausage", "onion"],
        },
        {
          type: "beverage",
          name: "Diet Pepsi",
          size: "16oz",
        },
      ],
    }
